# 1)  What is a list in Python and what are some common use cases?
#  Lists are an ordered sequential mutable data type that store multiple values.
'''
'''
# 2) What are some common use cases for dictionaries?
# To store a collection of key value pairs.
'''
'''
# 3) What is a nested data structure, and how can you access its elements?
# Nested data structures are data structures within data structures, eg [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]; array[0][1] gives 2.
'''
'''
# 4) What are the key differences between a list and a tuple in Python, and when would you use one over the other?
# Lists are mutable, tuples arent. Tuples can be used when the collection cant or shouldnt change
'''
'''
# 5) How can you use Python's built-in functions and methods to manipulate and sort lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, and what should you watch out for when working with these data structures?
# You can use methods like .sort() .max() .count() ... so on to perform different operatons with the data strctures.
